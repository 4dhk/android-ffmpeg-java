You should really compile these binaries yourself, using the include external/android-ffmpeg project. However, we do understand that not everyone has the NDK installed, and some people just want to use this library without compiling the entire ffmpeg code.

Once compiled, you will find the binaries at:

../../external/android-ffmpeg/ffmpeg/ffmpeg

and

../../external/android-ffmpeg/data/data/info.guardianproject.ffmpeg/app_opt/bin/sox
